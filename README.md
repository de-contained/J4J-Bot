# Join-For-Join Bot
A bot that automatically does join-for-join, but there are some things that can't really consider this as a join-for-join bot

## Statistics
The bot can be used as a little boost in server members, that can atleast average `~3/5` members every `5` to `10` minutes. It really depends on how unintellegent the people are when they send the `j4j` message. Some members can leave after some-time because they think the bot is actual user.

## Requirements
```
discord
programming knowledge

## Common Issues
Flask automatically being turned on when you connect your client, which can be easily fixed, direct message me on discord, bongo#4444, for more information regarding this application
